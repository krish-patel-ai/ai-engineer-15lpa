# Tuples & Immutability

## What is a tuple?
A tuple is a collection of values like a list, but once created it cannot be changed.

## Difference between list and tuple
A list can be changed after creation.
A tuple cannot be changed, which makes it safer.

## What is immutability?
Immutability means data cannot be modified after it is created.

## Why industry prefers immutability
Immutable data prevents accidental changes.
It makes code more predictable and easier to debug.

## Common interview questions
Why use tuple instead of list?
Because tuple ensures data does not change accidentally.
