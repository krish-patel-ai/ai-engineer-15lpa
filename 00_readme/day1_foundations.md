DAY-1: AI ENGINEER FOUNDATION

1. What is AI?
AI is about building systems that can learn patterns from data
and make predictions on unseen data.

AI is NOT:
- hardcoded rules
- if-else logic everywhere

AI IS:
- learning from data
- generalizing to new data


2. Why memorization fails
If a model memorizes data:
- it performs well on training data
- it fails on unseen data

This is called OVERFITTING.

Real AI systems must generalize.


3. Core AI Goal
Train a system that:
- learns patterns
- ignores noise
- performs well on unseen data


4. Why most learners fail (90%)
- they rush
- they memorize definitions
- they copy code
- they don’t understand failures

Industry wants thinkers, not memorizers.


5. AI Engineer vs Student
Student:
- learns syntax
- follows tutorials

AI Engineer:
- understands why things work
- debugs failures
- explains trade-offs
- builds pipelines


6. Mental model (VERY IMPORTANT)
Everything in AI follows:
Input → Processing → Output

This appears in:
- Python functions
- ML models
- Neural networks
- APIs
- LLM pipelines
