# Day-8: Git Basics (AI Engineer)

## What is Git?
Git is a version control system.
It tracks changes in code so we can save, review, and revert work safely.

Git is mandatory in industry for collaboration and production code.

## Git vs GitHub
Git:
- Tool installed locally
- Tracks file history

GitHub:
- Online platform
- Stores Git repositories remotely

## Basic Git Flow
1. git init       → start tracking a project
2. git add        → select files to track
3. git commit     → save a snapshot with a message

## File States in Git
- Untracked: Git sees the file but is not tracking it
- Staged: File is ready to be committed
- Committed: File is saved in Git history

## git status
git status shows:
- which files are untracked
- which files are staged
- whether the working tree is clean

Engineers run git status frequently to avoid mistakes.

## Why Git is important for AI Engineers
- Tracks experiments and code changes
- Prevents accidental loss of working pipelines
- Enables collaboration in teams
- Makes work auditable and professional

## Interview Point
I use Git to track changes, commit logical checkpoints, and maintain clean version history for my projects.
