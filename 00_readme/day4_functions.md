DAY-4: FUNCTIONS FOR AI ENGINEERS

1. What is a function?
A function is a reusable block of code that:
- takes input
- applies logic
- returns output

Mental model:
Function = Input → Logic → Output


2. Why functions are CRITICAL in AI
AI systems repeat:
- preprocessing
- training
- evaluation

Without functions:
- code duplication
- bugs
- unmaintainable systems

Functions = professional code.


3. print vs return (VERY IMPORTANT)

print:
- shows output
- cannot be reused

return:
- gives output back to program
- reusable
- required for ML pipelines

Rule:
ML code depends on return, not print.


4. Multiple inputs (industry reality)
Real AI functions take:
- features
- labels
- parameters
- configs

Single-input functions are rare.


5. Naming functions
Bad:
def f(x):

Good:
def calculate_average_metric(metrics):

Clear naming = engineer level.


6. Common mistakes
- logic outside functions
- hardcoded values
- mixing tasks
- using print instead of return

These cause:
- interview rejection
- fragile ML code


7. Industry usage
Functions appear in:
- preprocessing
- feature scaling
- metric calculation
- training loops
- APIs

Weak functions = weak AI engineer.


8. Exercise context
Metric aggregation exercise represents:
- real ML evaluation code
- interview-level logic
